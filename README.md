PhD research focuses on the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Health. Using social media and searching data, my works provide real-world evidence to understand public opinions and sentiments and online information-seeking behaviors. Currently exploring the impact of generative AI on the research pipeline and the potential health applications.
