PhD, Health Informatics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University

PhD research focuses on the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Health. Using social media and searching data, my works provide real-world evidence to understand public opinions and sentiments and online information-seeking behaviors. Currently exploring the impact of generative AI on the research pipeline and the potential health applications.
